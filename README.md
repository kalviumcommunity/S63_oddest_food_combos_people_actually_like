Project Title:  Weirdest Food Combinations That People Actually Like

Overview
The site should be a space for users to share and find weird food combinations that people love. For example, one could love the practice of dipping fries in ice cream, while another person would have it no other way but to have jam on scrambled eggs. One can add unique combos, while others can comment and vote for them.

This is a very entertaining and collaborative concept that has a very funny and enticing touch to it, which makes it a must-do for any users, also being an ideal beginners-to-intermediate-level project for developers.

Examples:

Peanut Butter and Pickles
Salty, tangy twist on creamy sweetness of peanut butter.

Fries Dipped in Milkshake
It's a perfect hot and salty combination of fries with a cold and sweet milkshake.

Pizza with Ketchup
Because pizza needs some extra tomato sauce apparently

Banana and Mayonnaise Sandwich
Sweet bananas paired with creamy and tangy mayo.

Cheese on Apple Pie
A slice of cheddar melted over warm, flaky apple pie.

Ice Cream and Soy Sauce
The saltiness of soy sauce complements the sweetness of vanilla ice cream.

Popcorn with Hot Sauce
A spicy version of buttery popcorn.

Watermelon and Feta Cheese
A refreshing combination of sweet and salty flavors.

Oreos and Orange Juice
Dunk Oreos in OJ instead of milk for a tangy twist.

Rice and Ketchup
A simple, sweet condiment served with plain rice.

Key Features:

Submissions: Unique food combo entries by users
Comments: Opinions or reactions of other users to the combos
Ranking System: Ranking of combos is done on the basis of votes of users, i.e., likes/dislikes

Tech Stack:

Front-end: React- building an interactive user interface
Back-end: Express.js-for handling API requests and server logic
Database: MongoDB-user submissions, comments, and votes are stored.
Key tools are parts for the submission forms, combo displays, and voting mechanisms.

Backend: Express.js

Controls the server-side logic and API endpoints.

User authentication, processing of submissions, and database operations are also taken care of here.

Database: MongoDB

Storing user information, food combo submissions, votes, and comments. Suitable for flexible schema-less data storage, particularly with content like lists and user-generated data.

Optional Tools:

Cloudinary: This is useful for hosting and managing user-uploaded images of food combos.

JWT/Session: Useful for secure user authentication and session management.
This stack makes the application lightweight, efficient, and scalable. Perfect for full-stack web development.

Reason to why this project:

This is a simple but interesting project where hands-on experience will be developed through CRUD operations: Create, Read, Update, Delete. This also deals with user authentication, data handling, and front-to-back integration.
